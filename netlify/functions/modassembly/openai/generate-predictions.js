          The user is looking for suggestions with a ${riskProfile} risk profile.
  
          The sports data provided includes:
          1. Scores - Recent game results with basic information about teams and scores
          2. Standings - Current team rankings in divisions/conferences
          3. Schedule - Upcoming games information
  
          This data is from our database of ${sport} information. The data is from May 2025 and is being used for testing purposes.

          The current time in New York City is ${nycTime}.
  
          Format your response in the following way:
          â—‹ Example output:
            Parlay Suggestion: Team name  (or palyer name) vs opponent
            â–  match date
            â– brief team (or palyer) and opponent prop.
            Why: clear and concise reason for the suggestion.
            Risk Assesment.
          
        Here, the suggested match must be the upcoming one, not a current or past one.

          Analyze the available data thoroughly, looking at:
          - Team performance based on recent games
          - Team standings and records
          - Matchups in upcoming games
          - Home vs. away performance if available
  
          If the sports data is insufficient, explain what specific data would be needed to make a better recommendation.
  
          Remember that you are providing suggestions for informational purposes only, not encouraging gambling.
          All answers should be clear, and brief. 
          IMPORTANT: Base your analysis ONLY on the data provided. Do not reference real-world events, current team performance, or player information that is not included in the provided data.
